      <h1>Things to Find</h1>
      <h2>Structures</h2>

      <p>
        There are a handful of structures to find across Mutablus.
        Some are fairly common while others are tougher to find.
        Here is a complete list of each structure and where to find it:
      </p>

      <ul class="help-list">
        <li>
          <span class="bold">House</span> - usually found near mountains.
          Houses are fairly common and can appear by themselves or in rare mountain cities.
          They only crop up in grassy areas and contain workbenches (needed to craft shovels).
        </li>
        
        <img src="images/screenshots/caves.png" alt="Caves">

        <li>
          <span class="bold">Cave</span> - a common small structure.
          Caves appear in stoney areas, typically in groups of 3 or more.
          Each cave has a small number of picks for you to collect.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="bold">Boat</span> - an abandoned ship.
          They appear on the water, sometimes docked in a small pool.
          Boats are uncommon and contain nothing of value.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="bold">Pyramid</span> - home of the pharoah.
          Pharoahs offer orbs in exchange for idols and ore.
          Pyramids are uncommon and appear exclusively in sandy areas.
        </li>
        
        <img src="images/screenshots/towersnowmen.png" alt="Tower surrounded by snowmen">

        <li>
          <span class="bold">Tower</span> - the rarest structure in Mutablus.
          Towers offer free orbs, making them a much easier alternative to gathering ore for pharoahs.
          Towers are rare, appearing only in snowy areas.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Biomes</h2>

      <p>
        Mutablus hosts a variety of biomes.
        Here are some fun ones to keep an eye out for:
      </p>

      <ul class="help-list">
        
        <img src="images/screenshots/snowmen.png" alt="Snowmen">
        
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Field of Snowmen</span> - pay attention!
          Some are missing their arms and could use a hand.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Mountain Range</span> - like a forest, but wih big, annoying mountains instead of trees.
          Good luck getting through.
        </li>
        
        <img src="images/screenshots/necropolis.png" alt="Necropolis">
        
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Necropolis</span> - a desert dotted with pyramids and dig sites.
        </li>

        <img src="images/screenshots/stoneforest.png" alt="Stone forest">

        <li>
          <span class="bold">Stone Forest</span> - water has started pooling in the stone here.
          Grass grew and caves formed.
        </li>

        <img src="images/screenshots/ocean.png" alt="Ocean">
        
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Ocean</span> - a large body of water, often with boats.
        </li>

        <img src="images/screenshots/truedesert.png" alt="True desert">

        <li>
          <span class="bold">True Desert</span> - a full screen of sand.
          That's it.
        </li>

        <img src="images/screenshots/mountaincity.png" alt="Mountain city">
        
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Mountain City</span> - the rarest biome in Mutablus.
          Mountain cities are home to loads of houses and mountains.
          They are extremely difficult to navigate without picks, so come prepared!
        </li>
      </ul>
