      <h1>How to Play</h1>
      <h2>Controls</h2>

      <ul class="help-list">
        <li>
          WASD/Arrow Keys - Move, Interact
        </li>
        <li>
          Space - Use Orb
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>
        Mutablus is a simple exploration game.
        You will start in a randomly generated area possibly including trees, rivers, and snowmen.
        Walk off-screen in any direction to enter a new area.
        You will find houses, boats, pyramids, and other structures in the world.
        Walk into things to interact with them.
      </p>

      <h2>Mutablus Mutates</h2>

      <p>
          When you enter a new area, the previous area will transform.
          Forests might become slightly different forests and deserts might become oceans.
          Keep this in mind when entering buildings - you won't always walk out to the same area you entered from!
      </p>

      <h2>Items</h2>

      <p>
          You will notice a handful of icons on the left side of your screen.
          These are items you can collect and use.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Here's all you need to know about each item:
      </p>
      <ul class="help-list">
        
        <img src="images/inv/Log.png" alt="Log">

        <li>
          <span class="bold">Log</span> - collected by breaking a tree (just walk into it).
          They can also be found laying near trees.
          Logs allow you to cross water and, more importantly, put arms on snowmen.
        </li>
        
        <img src="images/inv/Ore.png" alt="Ore">

        <li>
          <span class="bold">Ore</span> - found by mining a mountain.
          Pharoahs, found in pyramids, like ore and will trade you for orbs.
        </li>
        
        <img src="images/inv/Pick.png" alt="Pick">

        <li>
          <span class="bold">Pick</span> - breaks cave stalagmites and mountains.
          Picks are collected from caves and totems.
          Keep in mind that they are consumable and break after a single use!
        </li>
        
        <img src="images/inv/Shovel.png" alt="Shovel">

        <li>
          <span class="bold">Shovel</span> - excavates dig sites.
          These are crafted at workbenches in houses or received from totems.
          They are also consumable and break after a single use.
        </li>
        
        <img src="images/inv/Map.png" alt="Map">

        <li>
          <span class="bold">Map</span> - reveals a hidden point of interest nearby.
          Maps sometimes appear in caves and houses.
          You can always find one on a boat.
          Maps don't always reveal something when used.
        </li>
        
        <img src="images/inv/Orb.png" alt="Orb">

        <li>
          <span class="bold">Orb</span> - allows you to teleport to a new area.
          These are useful when you get stuck or want to quickly find something.
          They are obtained by trading ore to a pharoah or by finding a tower.
          If you don't want to collect these, you can "poor man's orb" by walking back and forth off the screen.
        </li>
        
        <img src="images/inv/Idol.png" alt="Idol">

        <li>
          <span class="bold">Idol</span> - found by excavating a dig site.
          Pharoahs LOVE idols and will give you 10 orbs in exchange for a single idol.
          Alternatively, you can place an idol atop a totem for a bunch of new tools.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>You've Got the Basics!</h2>

      <p>
        That's all you should need to get going.
        Once you have made some discoveries in the game for yourself, spy the Things to Find tab for more fun (and spoiler-y) stuff.
